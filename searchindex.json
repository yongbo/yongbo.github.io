Before that, let\u0026rsquo;s finish this document.\nUsage Maverick is build with modern Python, currently at least Python 3.5 is required, make sure you have it installed on your machine.\nInstall Clone this repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/AlanDecode/Maverick.git ./Maveric \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd ./Maveric  Install all dependencies:\npip install -r prod_req.txt  If error occurs, please verify your Python and pip version. Then get a copy of sample config file:\ncp ./config.sample.py ./config.py  For now let\u0026rsquo;s use the default configurations. Type this command in your terminal:\npython ./build.py  \u0026hellip;and a sample static site is generated in test_dist folder! You can then upload them to GitHub Pages or any other server.\nGenerate your own site By default, Maverick searches all .md files recursively under test_src folder, so put your Markdown files in it and run python ./build.py then everything you need will be in test_dist folder. Maverick uses so-called YAML frontmatter to get meta data of your articles, if you have tried Hexo or Jekyll, you should be familiar with it; if you don\u0026rsquo;t, let\u0026rsquo;s look into it now.\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nRead the full documentation here.\nLicense MIT © AlanDecode.\n","id":1,"section":"posts","summary":"Overview Maverick is a static blog generator built with python.
